## Usage

  Cars,
  About,
  Contact,
  CarReservationModal,
  Button,
  Card,
} from "@/components";
```

Or from specific categories:

```typescript
import { Header, Footer } from "@/components/layout";
import { CarCard, RentSearch } from "@/components/car";
import { Button, Input } from "@/components/ui";
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization** - Components are grouped by purpose and functionality
2. **Improved Discoverability** - Easy to find related components
3. **Cleaner Imports** - Centralized exports through index files
4. **Maintainability** - Related components are co-located
5. **Scalability** - Easy to add new components to appropriate categories

## Guidelines

- Place components in the most appropriate category based on their primary purpose
- Update index files when adding new components
- Keep styles close to their components when possible
- Use absolute imports with the `@/components` alias for consistency
